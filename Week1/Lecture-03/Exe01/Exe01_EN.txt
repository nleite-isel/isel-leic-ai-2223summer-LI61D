Assume that given facts in the form: parent(name1, name2) (name1 is the father/mother of name2).

Define predicate brother(X, Y) which succeeds if X and Y are brothers.
Define predicate cousin(X, Y) which succeeds if  X and Y are cousins.
Define predicate grandson(X, Y) which succeeds if X is grandson of Y.

Consider the following genealogic tree:
   parent(jose, maria).   % 1                 
   parent(jose, pedro).   % 2
   parent(maria, luis).   % 3
   parent(maria, afonso). % 4
   parent(pedro, ana).    % 5

whose graphical representation is:
        jose
        /   \
      maria  pedro
     /   \        \
    luis  afonso   ana


For the following queries, indicate which answers, and in what order, are produced for your definitions:
